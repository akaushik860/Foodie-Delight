# Restaurant Management Web App

A web application that allows users to view, add, edit, delete, and search for restaurants. The app is built using React and includes responsive design, form validation, and simulated backend functionality.

## Features

- View a list of restaurants
- Add new restaurants
- Edit existing restaurants
- Delete restaurants
- Search for restaurants by name
- Responsive design
- Form validation
- Simulated backend functionality


## Installation

1) Install the necessary node modules

### `npm install`

2) In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Time Tracking

### Frontend Functionality

**Description**: Implementing core features such as displaying the list of restaurants, adding new restaurants, editing existing restaurants, deleting restaurants, and the search functionality.

- **Tasks**:
  - Setting up the initial React project.
  - Creating components for the restaurant list, form, and search bar.
  - Implementing state management for restaurant data.
  - Handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - Implementing the search functionality.
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Actual Time**: 2.5 hours
- **Comments**: The actual time was slightly longer due to handling some edge cases and ensuring smooth state transitions.

### Frontend Presentational Aspects (Styling, DOM, etc)

**Description**: Styling the application to be visually appealing and ensuring it is responsive across different devices.

- **Tasks**:
  - Writing CSS/SCSS for the layout and components.
  - Implementing responsive design using media queries and flexible layouts.
  - Ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Actual Time**: 2.5 hours
- **Comments**: More time was spent on fine-tuning the responsive design and ensuring consistency across different screen sizes.

### Required Validations

**Description**: Adding validation logic to the form for adding and editing restaurants.

- **Tasks**:
  - Implementing client-side validation rules.
  - Displaying appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
  - Ensuring validation logic is consistent across all form operations.
- **Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours
- **Actual Time**: 1.5 hours

### Unit Test Coverage

**Description**: Writing unit tests to cover the core functionality and ensure the application works as expected.

- **Tasks**:
  - Setting up a testing framework (e.g. React Testing Library).
  - Writing tests for components, state management, and form validation.
  - Ensuring a high level of test coverage.
- **Estimated Time**: 1 hours
- **Actual Time**: 1 hours

## Summary

- **Frontend Functionality**: 2.5 hours
- **Frontend Presentational Aspects**: 2.5 hours
- **Required Validations**: 1.5 hours
- **Unit Test Coverage**: 1 hours

### Total Time

- **Actual Total Time**: 7.5 hours

## Notes

- **Mocked Backend APIs**: As this is a frontend assignment, I have not implemented actual backend APIs. Instead, I have mocked the backend functionality to simulate API responses.
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - **Optimization**: Optimize the state management and rendering process for better performance.
  - **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading of components to improve initial load time.
  - **Pagination**: Add pagination to handle a large number of restaurant entries efficiently.
  - **Advanced Search**: Enhance the search functionality to include filters based on different restaurant attributes.
  - **Improved Error Handling**: Implement better error handling for form validation and other operations.
  - **Testing**: Increase test coverage to include integration and end-to-end tests.
